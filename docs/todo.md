# Todo

## Diagnostics follow-ups

- Keep probes side-effect light (small temp files, short-lived checks).
- Standardize probe result details for operator-friendly output.
- Continue lazy imports for optional dependencies so diagnostics can run anywhere.

## Next steps

- Expand hardware abstractions and mock drivers.
- Build user interaction pipelines (speech/text -> intent -> action).
- Add more external integrations in `services/`.
